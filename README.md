# Quantum Bot

# Why we create Quantum Bot?

AI should be accessible for everyone. We now have some products that people can use. However, for AI based data processing, only small amount of people who know programming and know AI can access it. 

This project wants to make ordinary people that cannot do programming and know almost nothing about AI can use the power of AI to analyze their data, with simple clicks.

# No clue how to analyze the results?

No problem. We will use LLM as much as possible to explain technical things in our software. So, you just prepare the dataset, click, and read the analysis provided. Boom...!!!! You become a data analyst in less than one minute :D
